title: "E-Seed Plus: Bio-Inspired Self-Drilling Seeds"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "How can engineered seeds autonomously plant themselves in soil? Building on the original E-Seed concept, this project advances both performance and manufacturability through material and geometric innovations. The new design introduces modular construction, bilayer tails for enhanced actuation, wax shell tips with plant fibers for orientation, and 3D-printed connectors for scalable assembly. Using chemical washing, molding, and flocking techniques, the team fabricated and tested multiple versions, demonstrating successful soil drilling and germination potential. Beyond improving efficiency, E-Seed Plus also considers pathways for mass manufacturing, highlighting the promise of bio-inspired mechanisms for large-scale reforestation and ecological restoration
