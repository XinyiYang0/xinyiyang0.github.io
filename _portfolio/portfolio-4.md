title: "Computational Textiles: FlexiMesh"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "How can we design fabrics whose elasticity changes depending on where and how they are stretched? This project introduces FlexiMesh, a computational pipeline for creating 3D printed textiles with localized anisotropic elasticity. By combining four parametric lattice units with mechanical simulation and SLA printing, FlexiMesh lets designers assign region-specific stretch and stiffness within a single continuous surface. The result is textile-like structures that can be tuned for support, flexibility, and actuation, opening applications in rehabilitation devices, adaptive apparel, soft robotics, and deployable aerospace structures <br/><img src='/images/fleximesh.gif' width='500'>"
