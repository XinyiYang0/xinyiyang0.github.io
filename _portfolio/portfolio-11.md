title: "Iterative Yo-Yo Design and Fabrication"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "This project explores the end-to-end process of toy making through the design and fabrication of a custom yo-yo. Using CNC machining to produce molds, injection molding to form the body, and vacuum forming for plastic components, we refined each iteration through trial and error to control defects and improve part quality. Across multiple design versions, adjustments were made to geometry and assembly until the yo-yo achieved both functional performance and a clean snap-fit finish. The project demonstrates how iterative prototyping and precision manufacturing techniques can converge to create playful yet robust consumer products. <br/><img src='/images/yoyo.png' width='500'>"
