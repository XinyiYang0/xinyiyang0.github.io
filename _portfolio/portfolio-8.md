title: "Aerogami: Inflatable Origami Robot"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "How can origami inspire soft, inflatable robots? This project explores the use of TPU sheets and pneumatic actuation to create lightweight, foldable robots powered by the FlowIO platform. Through iterative design, we tested fabrication methods from heat-press sealing to 3D printing, and investigated how geometric folding patterns influence motion. From simple rolling and grasping behaviors to a three-legged bio-inspired prototype, Aerogami demonstrates how origami principles can translate into adaptive robotic systems. While challenges remain in locomotion control, this work highlights the potential of inflatable origami robots for deployable, low-cost applications in exploration and interaction <br/><img src='/images/informal.gif' width='500'>"
