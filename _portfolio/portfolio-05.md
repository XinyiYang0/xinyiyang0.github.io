title: "Interactive Computing Fabric"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "What if fabrics could sense gestures as naturally as our skin does? This project explores knitted textiles embedded with conductive fibers that transform fabric into a responsive interface. The system can detect not only single or multiple touches but also precise touch locations and even gestures made without direct contact, such as waving a hand above the surface. By blending softness with sensing, this computing fabric opens opportunities for wearable interfaces, interactive environments, and human-centered design. <br/><img src='/images/computing_fabric.gif' width='500'>"
