title: "VR Spatial Sensing: Bridging 2D Devices and 3D Environments"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "How can everyday devices interact seamlessly with virtual reality? This project develops a system that links smartphones to VR headsets using ultra-wideband (UWB) localization and Wi-Fi communication. By measuring azimuth angles between anchors and tags, the system enables phones to act as interactive instruments in VR, triggering sounds and visual responses. Experiments show that wider anchor separation and closer distances improve accuracy, with 50 cm spacing producing the best balance between reliability and practicality. The results highlight how spatial sensing can extend VR experiences beyond headsets and controllers, creating richer multi-device interactions <br/><img src='/images/VR.png' width='500'>"
