title: "Rapid Folding via Pull Up Nets"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "Can you imagine everything in the world folded into 3D from a flat 2D sheet? Pull Up Nets is a fabrication method that transforms flat 2D nets into complex 3D shapes with a single pull. This approach reimagines how everyday objects and structures can emerge from sheets, opening possibilities for design, rapid prototyping, and deployable systems. <br/><img src='/images/pullup.png' width='500'>"
