title: "Underwater Robotic Tag: Vacuum Re-generator"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "How can we make suction tags stick better to whales without electronics? This project develops a **passive vacuum re-generator** system that uses diving pressure and mechanical syringes to increase suction force. By exploring different syringe volumes, valve settings, and suction cup geometries, we aim to design reliable, electronic-free underwater tags for marine animal research. <br/><img src='/images/underwater_tag.gif' width='500'>"
