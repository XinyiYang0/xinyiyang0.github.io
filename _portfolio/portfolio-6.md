title: "Zero-Gravity Fashion: Interactive Space Garment"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "As commercial spaceflight grows, how might fashion shape the experience of future life in space? This project explores the intersection of couture and zero-gravity through a fully 3D-printed garment composed of 221 interlocking pieces assembled without adhesives. Embedded with 50 LEDs linked to IMU sensors, the garment responds to body movement, creating a dynamic light display in weightlessness. Beyond aesthetics, the work examines fabric morphology in microgravity and reimagines the role of women in space, connecting the history of female contributions to spacesuit design with the possibility of new, expressive forms of spacewear. Positioned at the boundary of science, art, and society, this project envisions a future where high fashion extends into orbit. <br/><img src='/images/zero_G_full.png' width='500'>"
