Hi, I’m Xinyi Yang, a PhD researcher in Robotics at Georgia Tech.
My work sits at the intersection of aerospace, structures, and mechanism design, with a strong focus on novel mechanical systems, robotics dynamics, and adaptive materials.

I am especially interested in:
- Designing and fabricating programmable structures that adapt to their environment;
- Developing inverse design for robotics and materials;
- Exploring multidisciplinary approaches that bridge engineering, design, and fabrication.

Outside of research, I enjoy hands-on prototyping, data-driven analysis, and collaborative projects that connect robotics with broader applications in aerospace systems and human-centered design.

Research
======
My research frames geometry as a functional language for creating autonomous and adaptive systems. By embedding function into shape and material architecture, I explore how structures can sense, respond, and adapt to their environment without relying on continuous control or electronics. This approach opens pathways to lightweight, resilient, and programmable systems for robotics, aerospace, and deployable mechanisms.
